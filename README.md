# dcode

Distributed Code Editor.

## Why?

You do your best work offline. Your team needs online. Ever wondered how to solve this dilemma? The solution is to use tools that work offline but also support [asychronous communication](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/) and synchronisation when online. With the [dat protocol](https://datprotocol.org) and [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) it has become easier than ever to build reliable tools to do just that.

This project provides a basic `dfurl` compatible code editor. [Try it](https://dcode.hashbase.io/) yourself in Beaker.

## How?
